            A personal computer is a general-purpose, cost-effective computer that is designed to be used by a single end-user. Every PC is dependent on microprocessor technology, which allows PC makers to set the entire central processing unit (CPU) on a single chip.

            Businesses make use of PCs to perform tasks like accounting, desktop publishing and word processing as well as to run database and spreadsheets. At home, PCs are mainly used for multimedia entertainment, playing PC games, accessing the Internet, etc. Even though PCs are intended to use as single-user systems, it is normal to connect them together to create a network, such as a local area network (LAN).

            In the mid 1960s and into the 1970s, computers occupied entire rooms and were only affordable by large universities and enterprises. These early computers were accessed by multiple users via attached terminals. Resources were shared among all users. The term PC became popular in the early 1980s, building on Time Magazineâ€™s choice of PC as the Man of the Year for 1982. By the late 1980s, technology had advanced far enough that a small computer could be used and owned by a single individual.
