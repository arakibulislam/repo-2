            What Does Personal Computer (PC) Mean?
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            A personal computer is a general-purpose, cost-effective computer that is designed to be used by a single end-user. Every PC is dependent on microprocessor technology, which allows PC makers to set the entire central processing unit (CPU) on a single chip.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            Businesses make use of PCs to perform tasks like accounting, desktop publishing and word processing as well as to run database and spreadsheets. At home, PCs are mainly used for multimedia entertainment, playing PC games, accessing the Internet, etc. Even though PCs are intended to use as single-user systems, it is normal to connect them together to create a network, such as a local area network (LAN).
